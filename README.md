# MINESWEEPER (MASM)
This Minesweeper game project is written in Assembly language using the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM). The game consists of a grid of tiles, some of which contain hidden mines. The player's objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines. The game is implemented with a simple console-based user interface that allows the player to select tiles and mark them as potentially containing mines.

## Requirements
- MASM: This project requires the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) to see the code (for example Notepad++)
- Windows OS: This project is designed to run on Windows operating system.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the command 'example_03.exe' to start the game.
3. Use mouse to select tiles.
4. Clear all non-mine tiles to win the game.

## Visuals
This Minesweeper game project is a great way to learn about assembly language programming and computer game development. It is a challenging but rewarding project that can help you develop your skills in low-level programming and game design. Have fun playing and improving the game!
